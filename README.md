# TestCafe Study Project

This is a TestCafe study project that aims to demonstrate end-to-end testing using TestCafe. It is still a work in progress and serves as a learning tool.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)


## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- TestCafe: a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
- dotenv: a zero-dependency module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rapesil/test-cafe-study.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and define the necessary environment variables. For example:

```
VALID_USERNAME=standard_user  
USERNAME_BLOCK=locked_out_user  
VALID_PASSWORD=secret_sauce  
```

> I know, the username and password are openly displayed on the test login page, but I want to use `.env` to provide an example of how to hide sensitive data in my project.

2. Run the tests:

```
npm test
```

This command will execute the TestCafe tests defined in the project.
